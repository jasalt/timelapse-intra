* Automated timelapse & weatherstation setup
- Raspberry Pi with webcam
- Linux box in the same network for processing and uploading to Youtube
- Weatherstation
** Installation notes
*** Prereq
Usernames are pretty much hardcoded currently. Change names "pi" and "jarkko" to target usernames.

Setup SSH keypairs for passwordless login:
- Laptop > pi and kitchen
- kitchen > pi

Setup passwordless sudo usage or use option =--ask-sudo-pass= in =ansible-playbook= command.

For weatherstation set env vars 'WUNDERGROUND_STATION_ID' and 'WUNDERGROUND_PASSWORD' for local environment.

*** Ansible 
Running playbook:
- Setup everything =ansible-playbook -i ./hosts site.yml=
- Limit to specific machine =ansible-playbook -i ./hosts -l kitchen site.yml=
- Limit to tasks with tag "script" =ansible-playbook -i ./hosts -l raspberry --tags script site.yml=
